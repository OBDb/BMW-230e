It combines a 1.5L turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor integrated into the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, delivering a combined system output of approximately 326 HP and 477 Nm of torque. The xDrive system provides all-wheel drive capability with the combustion engine powering the front wheels and the electric motor driving the rear wheels. The 14.9 kWh lithium-ion battery enables an electric-only range of around 90 km (56 miles) under the WLTP cycle. Performance is impressive for its class, with 0-100 km/h acceleration in approximately 5.5 seconds. The 230e features BMW's latest interior technology, including the curved display combining digital instruments and infotainment, and offers multiple driving modes to optimize efficiency or performance as needed. This model represents BMW's commitment to electrification across its lineup while maintaining performance characteristics."
